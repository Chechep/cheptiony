        I love building interactive and visually stunning web.
        My focus is on crafting efficient, scalable and user-friendly applications
        that merge creativity with functionality that solve-world problems. Outside coding, 
        I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source and gazing at the night sky for inspiration.
